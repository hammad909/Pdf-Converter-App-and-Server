2. Real World Problem
Many businesses, particularly SMEs and dropshippers, face challenges with disorga-
nized logistics and a lack of real-time inventory tracking, which cause inefficiencies and
hinder sales opportunities. They also struggle to find suitable and affordable warehouse

--- Page 4 ---
spaces, which impact their ability to scale and manage order fulfillment effectively. With-
out optimized order routing and warehouse selection, businesses incur high logistics costs
and face delays in shipping. These challenges limit growth and profitability. Address-
ing these issues requires a solution that enhances visibility, streamlines logistics, and
optimizes supply chain efficiency to reduce costs and improve performance. A modern
approach provides tangible benefits across many industries.
Fragmented logistics and inefficient storage utilization will adversely affect key stake-
holders. E-commerce retailers, dropshippers, and SMEs will encounter order fulfillment
delays, higher operational expenses, and lower competitiveness due to inconsistent ware-
house availability. Warehouse operators will experience underused capacity, which will
resultinlowerrevenueandservicequality. Supplychainpartnerswillfacedisruptionsand
inefficiencies that will lead to shipment delays and increased costs for consumers. Market
performance will suffer as these challenges will spread through supply networks, which
will emphasize an urgent need for an integrated digital solution to mitigate inefficiencies
and optimize resource allocation.
